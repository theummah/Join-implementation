# Join-implementation
Join implementation in written in Python in linear time which I'm proud of, even though it's not a big deal. But seriously, the algorithm I wrote is a work of art.

Run like this please:
```
./run_join.sh
```

You can optionally provide the python script with 4 arguments, 2 json files followed by 2 keys (fields) on which to join, the first key corresponding to the first file and the second key corresponding to the second file.
